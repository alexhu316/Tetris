# Tetris

ALEX HU: TETRIS. MADE FOR ICS4U.

Features of the game as originally intended:

	•Single player mode, where the user clears 40 lines 
	•Versus mode, where two players each try to outlast their opponent
	•Control Customization: Each player can change their controls, sensitivity, 
	and some visuals
	•Leaderboards: Users can view the name and duration of all previous games played 
	(to completion) and can sort the list by 4 criteria


Hints:

	•In single player, pressing the delete/backspace button will swap out the 
	currently held piece with a new, random one, and can be done as many times as 
	wished
	•In TetrisMain.java, set 'private final int LINES' to a lower number to make 
	games go by faster
	•In TetrisMain.java, set 'private final int hangTime' to a greater number to have 
	the pieces fall slower
	•The leaderboards.txt file is of the format (time in milliseconds + " " + name)
